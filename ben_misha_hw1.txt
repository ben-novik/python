Hi Ben,

Yesterday we were playing around with the arithmetic series:

S(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n

and after looking for different patternds, discovered the formula:

S(n) = (n+1)*n/2

We broke it down into cases where n is even and when n is odd, and it turned 

out that the formula is the same in both cases.

A) For your homework, I'd like you to try to discover a formula for:

odd(n) = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + .... + n

where n is always an odd number. 

B) Once you get that, can you discover a formula for sums of even numbers:

even(n) = 2 + 4 + 6 + .... + n

C) What is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + ..... + 101

D) What is 2 + 4 + 6 + .. + 100

E) There are formulas even for things like sums of square numbers, i.e.,

1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3 + 4*4 + ...

If you have the time, try to discover this formula.  Next time we will see 

how we can use a computer to add up series like this very quickly without 

knowing the "formula". :)
